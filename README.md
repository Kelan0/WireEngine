This is a game engine I created, focusing more on the physics side of game engines. Most of the projects I have worked on have been focused around graphics and rendering, so this was quite a challanging project, as I have never implemented the phycics simulations used in modern games.

The physics I have tried to implement mostly revolves around collision detection; realistic and accurate looking bounces and rolling of game objects. I plan to add other things such as particles and cloth phyciscs too though.
